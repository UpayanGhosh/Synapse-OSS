## 💡 What Makes This Different

Most AI chatbot projects are thin wrappers around an API call.
Synapse is an **11-subsystem architecture** that solves problems
most chatbots ignore:

| Problem                            | How Most Bots Handle It                               | How JARVIS Handles It                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory**                   | Stuff messages into context window until it overflows | Hybrid RAG — SQLite knowledge graph + Qdrant vector search + FlashRank reranking. Remembers everything, retrieves what's relevant in <350ms.           |
| **Personality**              | Static system prompt, same tone forever               | Soul-Brain Sync — continuously tracks mood, sentiment, language patterns. Rebuilds a behavioral profile every 50 messages. Personality evolves.        |
| **Model selection**          | One model for everything (expensive or dumb)          | Mixture of Agents — Traffic Cop classifies intent, routes to 5 specialist models. Casual chat doesn't burn expensive API credits.                      |
| **Privacy**                  | Everything goes to cloud APIs                         | The Vault — sensitive conversations route to a local Ollama model on LAN. Zero cloud leakage. Zero external logging.                                   |
| **Thinking**                 | Generate first token immediately                      | Dual Cognition — generates inner monologue, calculates tension between memory and current message, then responds.                                      |
| **WhatsApp reliability**     | Webhook timeout, lost messages, duplicates            | Async pipeline — FloodGate batching, deduplication, bounded queue, concurrent workers. Zero dropped messages.                                          |
| **RAM on consumer hardware** | "Just buy a bigger server"                            | Lazy-loading (ToxicScorer unloads after 30s idle), SQLite instead of NetworkX (99.2% memory reduction), thermal-aware workers. Runs on 8GB MacBook Air. |
| **Voice Notes**            | Ignore or crash                                       | Groq Whisper — 2-4s cloud transcription, zero local RAM, then processed like text through the full cognitive pipeline.                                       |

## ⚙️ Key Features

### Async Gateway Pipeline (Message Queue + Workers)

Messages enter through a multi-stage async pipeline (`gateway/`) that prevents webhook timeouts. A `FloodGate` (batch aggregator, 3s window) merges rapid-fire messages, a `MessageDeduplicator` (seen-set filter, 5-min window) absorbs retry storms, and a bounded `TaskQueue` (asyncio FIFO, max 100) feeds two concurrent `MessageWorker` instances. The webhook returns `202 Accepted` immediately — the cognitive pipeline processes in the background. **Zero dropped messages** under single-user load (~50-100 messages/day).

### Multi-Model Intent Router (Mixture of Agents Pattern)

A lightweight intent classifier (zero-shot Gemini Flash call) routes each message to the best-fit model: Gemini Flash for casual chat, Claude Sonnet for code generation, Gemini Pro for deep analysis, Claude Opus for critical review, or a local Ollama instance for private conversations. All models are accessed through a unified OpenAI-compatible proxy, making the system completely vendor-agnostic. A `CREDIT_SAVER` fallback gracefully downgrades to cheaper models when provider credits are exhausted.

### Hybrid Memory Retrieval (RAG)

The `MemoryEngine` combines a SQLite-backed knowledge graph (subject–predicate–object triples) with Qdrant vector search (`nomic-embed-text` embeddings). A temporal scoring function blends semantic similarity with recency. High-confidence results (>0.80) skip the reranker for speed; lower-confidence candidates pass through FlashRank (ms-marco-TinyBERT) for precision. Result: **<350ms P95 retrieval** across 37,000+ vocabulary terms.

### Soul-Brain Sync (Continuous Batch Profiling Pipeline)

Rather than static system prompts, the SBS pipeline continuously builds and evolves a 2KB behavioral profile per conversation target. A `RealtimeProcessor` (rule-based sentiment + language detection) captures mood signals on every message. A `BatchProcessor` runs periodically (every 50 messages or 6 hours) to distill conversation patterns into structured JSON layers (emotional state, linguistic style, vocabulary). The `PromptCompiler` injects this profile into the system prompt at inference time. **Why not fine-tuning?** Profile injection is model-agnostic and costs zero training compute — the persona adapts regardless of which LLM is active.

### Dual Cognition Engine (Pre-Response Reasoning Layer)

Before generating a reply, a `DualCognitionEngine` produces an inner monologue (chain-of-thought via Gemini Flash) and calculates a tension score (0.0–1.0) to detect emotional conflicts between retrieved memory and the current message. This cognitive context is injected into the prompt alongside memories and persona. The `LazyToxicScorer` (Toxic-BERT) loads on demand and auto-unloads after 30s of idle to conserve RAM — on an 8GB machine, every MB matters.

### Air-Gapped Local Inference ("The Vault")

Sensitive conversations route to a local Ollama instance on a dedicated compute node (RTX 3060Ti). Zero cloud API calls, zero external logging. Hemisphere integrity (the separation between cloud-routed and local-only memories) is verified by automated tests (`verify` CLI command).

### Voice Message Transcription (Groq Whisper)

Voice notes received via WhatsApp are transcribed using the Groq API (Whisper-Large-v3). Cloud-based transcription with zero local RAM impact — results in 2-4 seconds. Requires a `GROQ_API_KEY` (free tier available at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)).

### Web Browsing (Platform-Aware)

Synapse can browse the live internet using a headless browser. When the user asks a question requiring real-time data (weather, news, live scores), the `ToolRegistry` dispatches a browser session, extracts clean text, and feeds the result back to the LLM. Content is truncated to 3000 characters to protect context window limits. The backend is platform-aware: **Crawl4AI** on Mac/Linux, **Playwright** on Windows — the `search_web(url)` interface is identical on both.

### Implicit Feedback Detection (SBS Feedback Loop)

The SBS subsystem includes an `ImplicitFeedbackDetector` that watches for conversational corrections. If you tell Synapse "too long" or "be more casual", it automatically adjusts its persona profile (Banglish ratio, response length, formality) — no explicit configuration needed. Corrections take effect immediately; the batch processor reinforces them over time.

### Sentinel File Governance

A fail-closed file governance system (`sbs/sentinel/`) that controls what the AI agent can read, write, or delete. Files are classified as CRITICAL (total lockout), PROTECTED (read-only), MONITORED (read-write with audit logging), or OPEN. All access decisions are logged to an immutable JSONL audit trail.

### Thermal-Aware Background Maintenance (GentleWorker)

A background worker that prunes stale knowledge graph triples and optimizes databases — but only when the host machine is plugged in and CPU usage is below 20%. Designed for consumer hardware where every watt matters.

## 📐 Engineering Philosophy

- **Architectural Decision-Making:** Every major subsystem was redesigned at least once based on production feedback — not theoretical planning.
- **Constraint-Driven Engineering:** The entire system was optimized to run on a $999 laptop with 8GB RAM. Every design choice was made under real resource pressure.
- **Production Mindset:** This isn't a demo. It processes real messages, from real users, every day. Uptime, latency, and reliability are measured, not aspirational.
- **End-to-End Ownership:** One engineer. Full stack. From SQLite schema design to async Python workers to shell-script orchestration to real-time monitoring dashboards.
